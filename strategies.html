                <h2>Trend Following</h2>
                <p>Trend following strategies aim to capitalize on market momentum by buying when prices are rising and selling when they are falling. This approach is based on the belief that assets that have been moving in a certain direction will continue to do so for a period of time. Traders typically use technical indicators such as moving averages, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and ADX (Average Directional Index) to identify the trend and confirm its strength.</p>
                <div class="definition">
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> Trend following is a strategy that seeks to capture gains through the analysis of an asset's momentum, focusing on aligning trades with the prevailing market direction.

                        <li>It is essential to have a clear exit strategy to protect profits and minimize losses when the trend reverses.</li>
                        <li>Risk management is crucial; traders often use trailing stops to lock in profits as the trend continues.</li>

                <h2>Mean Reversion</h2>
                <p>Mean reversion strategies assume that prices will revert to their mean over time, allowing traders to profit from price corrections. This strategy is based on the idea that extreme price movements are often followed by a return to average levels. Traders typically identify overbought or oversold conditions using indicators like the RSI (Relative Strength Index) or Bollinger Bands, which help signal potential reversals.</p>

                        <li>Effective risk management is essential, as mean reversion trades can result in significant losses if the price continues to move against the position.</li>

                <h2>Breakout Trading</h2>
                <p>Breakout trading involves entering a position when the price breaks through a key level of support or resistance, signaling a potential price movement. This strategy relies on the idea that once a price level is breached, it will continue to move in the direction of the breakout due to increased momentum and trading volume. Traders often use chart patterns, such as triangles or flags, to identify potential breakout points.</p>
